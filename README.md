# Data Science Libraries in Python

> **This repository is written in English to reach a wider audience.**

Welcome to the **Data Science Libraries in Python** repository! This project is designed as a didactic resource to explore and understand essential Python libraries to help with your Data Science studies. Here, you'll find useful informations that'll help you master these tools.

## Objectives

- **Learn the purpose of each library**: Understand what each library is used for and its importance in the data science workflow.
- **Practice with code examples**: Explore clear, didactic examples using fictitious datasets.
- **Access curated resources**: Find links to documentation, books, and courses for deeper learning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders by **theme** to make navigation intuitive:

```
├── README.md
├── Data Science Workflow/
    ├── Data Manipulation/
    │   ├── numpy_basics.ipynb
    │   ├── pandas_data_cleaning.ipynb
    ├── Data Visualization/
    │   ├── matplotlib_basics.ipynb
    │   ├── seaborn_heatmaps.ipynb
    │   ├── plotly_interactive_charts.ipynb
    ├── Machine Learning/
        ├── sklearn_regression.ipynb
        ├── sklearn_classification.ipynb
        ├── xgboost_basics.ipynb
```

Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks that:
- **Introduce the library**: Highlight its main features and applications.
- **Provide code examples**: Demonstrate common tasks and workflows.
- **Include comments**: Explain each step of the code for better understanding.
